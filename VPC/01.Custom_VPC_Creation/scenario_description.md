# VPC Setup with Public and Private Subnets

## Scenario
We are creating a **VPC** with both **public and private subnets**, ensuring that the private subnets **do not have internet access**. 



## Conclusion 🎉
With this setup, public subnets can access the internet, while private subnets remain isolated. This is useful for security-sensitive applications like databases or internal services. 🚀
